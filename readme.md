# Binary Search Algorithm 
This is a program to find try and find a number at any given point within a list of 1 to 100. It will tell you the position of the number in the list. 

## What I learned 
- How to use the bisect module to do a binary search 
- Implement a binary search in Python, recursively and iteratively
- Recognize and fix defects in a binary search Python implementation
- Analyze the time-space complexity of the binary search algorithm 
- Search even faster than binary search
